# Contributing to Marine Science Foundataion / Series Data
# We would like to thank IPFS for inspiration and code. 

There are many ways to contribute to this Scientific development. We welcome contributions big and small!

### Help with the design

[Submissions under development]
If you have a suggestion regarding the overall design of IPFS (or if find an error),
please submit an [issue](https://github.com/MarineScienceFoundsation/SeriesData/issues/new).

This repository is a landing repository for SeriesData, and where any big updates will be posted. 
If you have an error with an [implementation](README.md#implementations), 
file an issue in the respective repository. If you have more questions 
about the abstracted design, you can also check [specs](https://github.com/MarineScienceFoundation/SeriesData/specs).

### Help with the implementations

Please contribute to the various [implementations](README.md#implementations) under development, or start another!

There are also other repositories that are part of MarineScienceFoundataion, 
listed in the [project directory](https://github.com/MarineScienceFoundation). Dive in and help out.

### Help with spreading the word

Please tweet, email, tell everyone about this. Marine Science Foundatoion will succeed only if many people 
use it and build on it.

### Help in other ways

[Email @bmcgarvey directly](mailto:bmcgarvey@marinesciencefoundation?subject=Contributing to SeriesData) 
if you'd like to help in other ways.
